Both files in this folder are related to the same project. The jupyter notebook, "NAME," shows an example of preparatory analysis, forecast development, and validation as well as a few visualizations created using matplotlib and seaborn. The second file, "p_wfm_erlang_forecast.py" shows an example of a script written for a production environment which was scheduled to run weekly, pullling data from SQL server, performing a series of forecast steps and transformations, outputting the results back to SQL, then executing a stored procedure on SQL server to perform further processing on the output.
